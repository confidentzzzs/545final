The current version supports Vicuna-7B and LLaMA2-7B as the language model. Need to prepare Vicuna-v0 7B weights and and prepare LLaMA-2-Chat 7B weights.

Then modify the llama_model in the configs/models/cheetah_vicuna.yaml to the folder that contains Vicuna weights and modify the llama_model in the configs/models/cheetah_llama2.yaml to the folder that contains LLaMA2 weights.
The pth model can be download in following link

For the checkpoint aligned with Vicuna 7B, please set the path to the pretrained checkpoint in the evaluation config file in eval_configs/cheetah_eval_vicuna.yaml at Line 10.
For the checkpoint aligned with LLaMA2 7B, please set the path to the pretrained checkpoint in the evaluation config file in eval_configs/cheetah_eval_llama2.yaml at Line 10.
